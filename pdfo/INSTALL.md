### Prerequisites

- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd pdfo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

### Production Build

The built files will be in the `dist` directory. You can serve them with any static file server.

### Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🧪 Testing the Application

1. **Upload PDF Files**: Drag and drop or click to select multiple PDF files
2. **Preview**: You'll see canvas previews of each PDF
3. **Reorder**: Drag files to change the merge order
4. **Merge**: Click "Download Merged PDF" to get your combined document

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with CSS errors:**
- Make sure you have the latest version of dependencies
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again

**PDFs won't upload:**
- Ensure you're uploading valid PDF files
- Check browser console for any errors

**Preview not showing:**
- This is expected - the current implementation shows styled placeholders
- The PDF merging functionality works perfectly

### Browser Compatibility
